# ML4Genomics

The followinng repository contains the code for projects 1 and 2 from the course 'Machine Learning for Genomics'. A short description of each project is provided below.

## Project 1

The primary objective of this project is to use epigenetic data, specifically ChIP-Seq and DNase-Seq data for multiple histone marks and chromatin accessibility, to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts gene expression for unseen cell lines. The workflow was divided into three key stages: data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. 

Data Preprocessing and feature engineering is carried out based on TSS-centered genomic windows to train an XGBoost model that will predict gene expression. Spearman's correlation on gene expression is utilized for evaluation of the model performance.
